    original: `The ubiquitous proliferation of digital media has fundamentally altered pedagogical paradigms, necessitating a re-evaluation of traditional instructional methodologies to accommodate diverse cognitive frameworks. This transformation requires educators to leverage emergent technologies to foster more inclusive and personalized learning ecosystems. Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.`,

    original: `The Renaissance period, spanning roughly from the 14th to the 17th century, marked a profound cultural transformation across Europe. This epoch witnessed unprecedented developments in art, science, literature, and philosophy, fundamentally reshaping Western civilization. The term "Renaissance" itself, meaning "rebirth" in French, encapsulates the era's emphasis on renewed interest in classical antiquity and humanistic values. Prominent figures such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Galileo Galilei epitomized the Renaissance ideal of the "universal genius" or "Renaissance man."`,

    original: `Photosynthesis is an intricate biochemical process whereby plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert light energy, typically from the sun, into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules. This complex process occurs in two main stages: the light-dependent reactions (photophosphorylation) and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle). The overall equation for photosynthesis can be represented as: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2.`,
